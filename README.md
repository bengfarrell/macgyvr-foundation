This is a foundation or project to use for scaffolding a MacgyVR project (Three.js + WebVR Boilerplate + Tween.js + more)

Intended use is that you'd clone this project, and use this as a starting point for your WebVR project

To start, npm install to get the bare minimum dependencies. A sample project can be run at index-dev.html on your own webserver.

This project contains a built-in webserver that also launches a JSON based 3D editor (a slightly modified ThreeJS Editor which can originally be found at https://threejs.org/editor/)

To use this built-in webserver, run:
> "npm run editor"

To access your project go to http://127.0.0.1:8125/index-dev.html
